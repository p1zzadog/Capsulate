# Capsulate
Capsulate is a time-capsule web application that allows users to create electronic time capsules filled with quirky information, small documents, and links which are unlocked after a specified length of time. Friends may be invited to contribute content to the capsule. An email is sent to the user and specified friends when the capsule unlocks.

This was my final project at RefactorU web development bootcamp, fall 2015 cohort.

Dependencies include:
-UI: Angular Material
-Front-end: AngularJS, UI-Router
-Back-end: NodeJS, ExpressJS
-noSQL Database: MongoDB
